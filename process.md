Perfect! That's a clean, simple flow. Here's how it works:

## Simple Flow:

### 1. User submits changes from Template app
- Template app shows **overlay dialog** immediately
- Dialog shows: "Processing changes..." with spinner

### 2. Template app calls Geenius function
```
POST to geenius-app.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/process-changes
```

### 3. Geenius function does everything synchronously:
- Creates StackBlitz sandbox
- Runs AI agent to make changes
- Creates feature branch
- Commits changes
- Creates PR
- **Waits for Netlify to deploy the feature branch**
- Returns all the links

### 4. Template app Dialog updates in real-time:
- "Creating sandbox..." ✓
- "AI agent working..." ✓  
- "Creating PR..." ✓
- "Deploying preview..." ✓
- **Shows preview link**: `feature-branch--my-app.netlify.app`

### 5. User clicks preview link to test changes

### 6. User refreshes original page to see updates

## Technical Requirements:

### Function timeout:
- Netlify functions have **15-minute limit**
- Should be enough for most changes

### Real-time updates:
- Function returns **Server-Sent Events** stream
- Or function returns **final result** after everything is done
- Dialog polls for status updates

### Netlify auto-deployment:
- Feature branches deploy automatically
- Function waits for deployment to be ready
- Returns the preview URL

## Questions:
1. **How many changes** do you expect per submission? (affects processing time)
2. **Should user approve each change** or auto-process all?
3. **What if processing takes longer than 15 minutes?**

This keeps it simple - one function call, immediate results, user refreshes to see final changes.

Yes, absolutely! That's a great idea. Here's how it would work:

## Simple Real-time Logs Setup:

### 1. When user submits changes:
- Template app calls Geenius function
- Function returns **session ID** immediately
- Overlay shows: "Processing... [View Logs]" button

### 2. "View Logs" opens new tab:
```
geenius-app.netlify.app/logs/[session-id]
```

### 3. Logs page shows real-time updates:
- "🔄 Creating StackBlitz sandbox..."
- "🤖 AI agent analyzing changes..."
- "📝 Implementing feature: Add user profile section"
- "🧪 Running tests..."
- "✅ Tests passed"
- "🔀 Creating PR: feature/user-profile"
- "🚀 Deploying to Netlify..."
- "✅ Preview ready: https://feature-123--my-app.netlify.app"

## Technical Implementation:

### Option A: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Function streams logs in real-time
- Logs page listens to the stream
- Works within 15-minute function limit

### Option B: WebSockets (via external service)
- Use service like Pusher or Socket.io
- Function pushes logs to WebSocket
- Logs page receives updates instantly

### Option C: Simple Polling
- Function writes logs to temporary storage
- Logs page polls every 2 seconds for updates
- Simpler but less real-time

## User Experience:
1. User submits changes
2. Gets overlay with session link
3. **Optional**: Opens logs in new tab to watch
4. Can close logs tab anytime
5. Original page shows final result when done

This gives power users the ability to see what's happening while keeping the main flow simple for everyone else.
