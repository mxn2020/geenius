2. **Validation** → AI validates changes for security and relevance
3. **Analysis** → Dependency analyzer determines optimal processing strategy
4. **Planning** → Lead agent creates strategic implementation plan
5. **Processing** → Multi-agent team processes changes file-by-file
6. **Testing** → Automated test generation and validation
7. **Deployment** → Preview deployment with comprehensive testing
8. **Review** → Pull request creation with detailed documentation
9. **Monitoring** → Real-time status updates throughout the pipeline

## 🔧 Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
```bash
# AI Providers
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_key
GROK_API_KEY=your_grok_key

# GitHub Integration

### Template App Update
Update the template app to use the new enhanced endpoint:
```javascript
const geeniusApiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_GEENIUS_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8888';
const response = await fetch(`${geeniusApiUrl}/api/process-changes-enhanced`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(submissionPayload),
});
```
